# Limit System
BChecker allows the user to choose a maximum number of hashes that will be cracked.<br>
Ex: If user select the number of 10, BChecker will try to crack 10 hashes and if successfully will stop the script and save the results.
# Cracking results
After BChecker finishing cracking, a txt file will be created with cracked hash information.<br>
The file can be bchecker_result.txt or bchecker_wp_result.txt and it will be located in the path where Shell is running.
